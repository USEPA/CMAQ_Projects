### Southwest U.S. Evaluation for Spring and Summer 2023

Daytime hourly O3 measurements at CASTNET sites in the southwest U.S. were paired with model predictions by pairs of months in Figure 1. The model tends to overestimate surface level O3 during the summer season. This tendency is not evident in other seasons in this region. 

Figure 1. Model predicted daytime hourly O3 matched with measurements made at CASTNET monitors in the southwest U.S. region. Warmer colors indicate a higher frequency of prediction-observation pairs.

Model predicted ozone (O3) was paired with vertical measurements made by aircraft as part of the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) (http://www.iagos.fr/cams/). These results are shown aggregated over all available flights in Figure 2. The results show that the model does well at capturing the vertical variability in measurements for the spring (Q2) and summer (Q3) seasons in 2023.
