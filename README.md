CMAQ Projects
=============

Configuration and evaluation information on Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model applications.

- **[RX-EQUATES](RXEQ.md)**: 
This product will consist of the development of a consistent set of modeled fire emissions from 2016 through 2023 for North America at 36 km spatial resolution. These new fire emissions will have a consistent methodology for emissions estimation and provide differentiation with respect to source (e.g., U.S., Canada, and Mexico) area for wildfire and fire type (e.g., prescribed broadcast burns, prescribed pile burns, etc.) for managed burns. Each type of fire will be tracked for contribution using the source apportionment feature in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for multiple years.
