North America 36 km CMAQ simulations
====================================

Annual simulations for 2023 were done for North America using CMAQv5.5 (epa.gov/cmaq).

The following is a list of input files and science options used in these CMAQ simulations.

Chemical mechanism: cb6r5
Aerosol module: aero7
Domain: North America using a 36 km grid size and Lambert Conformal projection assuming a spherical earth with radius 6370.0 km.
Vertical Resolution: 35 layers from the surface to 50 mb
Meteorological fields: WRF4.4.1
Emissions: 2022 anthropogenic emissions + lightning parameterization + BEIS biogenic VOC and soil NO, and BlueSky Pipeline wildland fire emissions
No bi-directional NH3 air-surface exchange
STAGE (E20) module for dry deposition
Windblown dust module turned off
